1. Count_MTPT.pl - perl script used to calculate the total number and length of plastid insertions (MTPTs). Input is a "xls" folder contaning all the BLASTN output table (mitochondrial genome agaist plastid genome, output format 6). It also can generate sequin format annotations.

2. Count_repeat.pl - perl script used to count the dispersed repeats. Input is a "fasta" folder containing the fasta format mitochondrial genomes and the BLASTN output tables (each mitochondrial genome agaist itself, output format 6). 

3. RNA-editing_stat_v1.1.pl - perl script used to count the RNA editings, including edit site number, position, substitution and coverage in total or per gene. Input file is a table generated by GENEIOUS software.  

4. violin plot.R - R script used to plot the violin plot. Input is a table of genome features, including genome size, GC content, intron number, etc.
